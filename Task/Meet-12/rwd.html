            <h1>Fixed Layout</h1>
            <p>
                Also known as a .container layout. Fixed 
                layout has specific pixel width values 
                that change its width value with the help 
                of media queries. It provides a responsive 
                fixed width container. Fixed layout resizes
                in chunks at several certain widths so 
                that's why its called as “fixed width” 
                because pixels values are specified.

            <h1>Fluid Layout</h1>
            <p>
                Also known as the .container-fluid 
                layout. This layout uses proportional 
                values such as measuring unit for a 
                block of content, images or any other 
                item. Used for creating an element that 
                is 100 % wider and covers all the screen 
                width. Fluid layout continuously resizes
                as you change the width of your browser 
                by any amount, leaving no extra empty 
                space on the sides ever Hence it is named 
                as “fluid layout”.
